# WinSCP PowerShell Module Wrapper
[![CI/CD](https://github.com/tomohulk/WinSCP/actions/workflows/Build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tomohulk/WinSCP/actions/workflows/Build.yml)

## Overhaul complete:
I have been revisiting this module as of late, add making some major changes:

1. New functions:
    * Get-WinSCPSession
    * Get-WinSCPHostKeyFingerprint
    * New-WinSCPSessionOption
    * New-WinSCPTransferResumeSupport
2. The `New-WinSCPSession` has been split into two functions, most of the configurations for the session have been moved to the `New-WinSCPSessionOption` command.  This will mimic the functionality of `New-CimSessionOption` and `New-CimSession`.
    * `PS C:\> New-WinSCPSession -SessionOption (New-WinSCPSessionOption -HostName ftp.tomohulk.github.io)`
3. The session is not longer auto disposed when passed in the pipeline, handling the session state is now your responsibility.
4. I am completely overhauling the help, and adding more examples using platyPS.
5. The `New-WinSCPSessionOption` defaults to using Anonymous authentication.
6. Updated pester tests.
7. Re implemented AppVeyor build.
8. Auto publishing to both PowerShellGallery.com and GitHub Releases.
9. Lots of bug fixes.

## Examples

```PowerShell
# Capture credentials.
$credential = Get-Credential

# Set the options to open the WinSCPSession with
$sessionOption = New-WinSCPSessionOption -HostName ftp.tomohulk.github.io -Protocol Ftp -Credential $credential

# Open the session using the SessionOptions object.
# New-WinSCPSession sets the PSDefaultParameterValue of the WinSCPSession parameter for all other cmdlets to this WinSCP.Session object.
# You can set it to a variable if you would like, but it is only necessary if you will have more then one session open at a time.
New-WinSCPSession -SessionOption $sessionOption

# Use that session to create a new Directory.
New-WinSCPItem -Path './remoteDirectory' -ItemType Directory

# Upload a file to the directory.
Send-WinSCPItem -Path 'C:\localDirectory\localFile.txt' -Destination '/remoteDirectory/'

# Close and remove the session object.
Remove-WinSCPSession
```
